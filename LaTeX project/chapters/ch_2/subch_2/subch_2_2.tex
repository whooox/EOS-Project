\normalsize{In this section, the fundamental principles and governing equations and each heat transfer mode are explored. The TZM-reflector tile is a highly constrained mechanical part that of the \acrshort{HS}. This part will be exposed to plasma radiation as well as the \acrshort{ECRH} beam. The heat transfer in this system is complex and need a good understanding of the theory to model it as good as possible.}

\normalsize{\indent The heat loads on the \acrshort{ECRH} reflector tile are specified further in the thesis but the theory first needs to be explained, at least what will be needed for this task.}

\subsection{General problem of heat exchange}
\normalsize{Heat exchange happens all the time and everywhere in nature, from the sun's radiative power to the heat transfer on the surface of the skin. Historically, heat was considered as some sort of} {\it flow} 
\normalsize{ that would flow from one hot object to another colder object \cites{ahtt6e}. The idea of an invisible fluid flowing from a body to another was first considered to explain this heat transport. While it is acceptable to consider such a concept for explaining heat transport, it is not satisfying enough to 
The general problem of heat transfer involves understanding how thermal energy is transported from one place to another.This energy transport can happen in different forms such as  }
