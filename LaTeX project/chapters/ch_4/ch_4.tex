\chapter{METHODS AND CONFIGURATIONS}
\normalsize{As stated in the state of the art; the object of these analyses is the \acrshort{ECRH} TZM-reflector tile (ref. E821). To study the thermal and mechanical behavior of this in-vessel component, finite element analysis using the ANSYS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} software will be carried out to evaluate the new design's performances and the proposed solution to the overheating of the CuCrZr heat sink issue. Coupled physics analyses, in particular one-way coupling and full coupling of thermal and structural analyses, will be used to assess the effects of the design changes and validate the proper functioning of the reflector tile in \acrshort{OP2} design loads.}
